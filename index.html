								<p>Hi my name is Patrick La. I am an Australian born Chinese that is currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University. I graduated high school in 2013, after graduating high school I got accepted into Bachelor of Computer and Network Systems at Victoria University. After half a year of the course I got too lazy and decided to defer from the course. During those years in between I ended up working for a bit with my father as we own a family business. It wasn’t until 2018 that I decided to come back to studying because of all the nagging from my parents. So here I am a 25-year-old student looking to complete my university degree and find a job after graduating.

One of my hobbies is that I enjoy eating. I am a big foodie and used to regularly visit brunch spots weekly and post it on Instagram. Fun fact is that I have completed a 2kg Japanese curry challenge before. Another hobby is that I enjoy playing video games. I have always been a very competitive person at a very young age I was introduced to competitive shooter games such as counter strike, I have been playing since the 1.5 – 1.6 days then I moved to other shooter games such as Combat Arms and Call of Duty where I was a leader of a clan and would recruit other members and versed other clans. During my Highschool years I would attend yearly LAN’s (LAN-slide) for Call of Duty tournaments.

								<p><b>Interest in IT</b></p>
</p>Honestly, I’m not too sure what my interest in IT is, but I do find it very intriguing. What I mean by intriguing is that I am honestly very amazed at how fast our technology is improving throughout the years, despite the internet being invented less than 30 years ago in 1989. My interest in IT started when I was in primary school when I would watch my auntie’s ex-boyfriend fix my mother’s old Pentium 4 computer. Her computer would constantly come up with a boot up error code and while he spent all day fixing it, I would just sit there and watch him. I don’t have many IT experiences to look back at but building custom computers would be one that interests me. 

The reason why I chose to come to RMIT was because I have heard great things about the university and that it offers a lot of IT Courses. RMIT has great reputation in the IT industry compared to Monash, Melbourne, Deakin and Swinburne University. I read on the website that RMIT has partnerships with Google, IBM, Deloitte and ANZ so that would help in the process of finding a job after I have finished my course. 

What I expect to learn during my studies is that I gain life skills during the process throughout the course. Life skills such as focus, critical thinking, improving my communication skills and the ability to take on any challenge that is thrown to me. I heard that from friends that have studied this course have said assignments would give me plenty of headaches from all the error codes from coding and all the stress. After completing this course, I hope by then I will be able to code with ease as coding is one of my weak points. I have discovered I enjoy subjects such as databasing or even networking.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/image01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38653882?searchrequesttoken=8610c314-0ebc-4f73-adae-3f6242663291&type=standout</p>
								
								<p>I have chosen “Senior Network/Senior Engineer as my ideal job. The job is apart of the company Sparx Solutions, I have heard many good reviews about the company. They have a reputation and have been included in the Australian Financial Review’s Fast Starters in 2018, 12th in CRN’s Fast 50 in 2018 and Juniper Network’s Emerging Partner of the Year in 2016. 
This position is appealing to me because it is a job that I cannot get straight away from graduating, it requires me to apply for other jobs within the field and work up towards this goal. 
As a Network/Security Engineer you must have strong technical knowledge and capabilities. The skills that are required for this position are having experience in routing and switching within the Cisco environment. This will require me to sign up for Cisco training and certifications in the future. You will also need to understand a lot in the security department. For Example, being able to analyse patterns of security events from firewalls, IDS, IPS, SIEM and other security data sources. The job also requires you to have an extensive knowledge in deploying and securing Microsoft Azure environment. Microsoft Azure is a public cloud computing platform which is used for virtual computing, storage and networking and plenty of other services.

The skills, qualifications and experience that I have currently are very barebones. I have a very weak coding knowledge as I have only worked with java. I have very basic knowledge in networking, but I have worked with a virtual machine before and setup roles. Very basic subnetting schemes and implementing IP v4 addressing and some very basic configuring & troubleshooting in ethernet networks via Cisco CLI on Router and Switch platforms.
</p>
		<p>My plan would be to finish my course in Bachelors of Information of Technology or i would possibly move into Computer Science or maybe even Software Engineering instead of the standard Information Technology course. I would obtain the skills and experience by getting professional industy certifications in security/networking</p>
		<p>For Example: CCNP(CISCO), CCIE(CISCO), PCNSE(Palo Alto Networks) - These certifications require you to take an exam.</p>

								<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
								<p>The results of this test seems very similar to how i am as a person. Upon doing the VAK learning styles questionanaire i found out that i was an auditory learner. An auditory learner means that i have a preference for the transfer of information through listening.These tests for me sums out how i really am as a person. </p>
								<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
								<p>The results of these tests would help me become a better person in a team. As i took the big five personality test i found out that i scored highest in "Agreeableness". This means that i would put others needs ahead of my own, and to work together rather than compete with others.</p>
								<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
								<p>Upon doing the tests/questionnaires i have found out that i wouldn't be suitable in a leader role but would be suitable in a support role instead. I find that I tend to get pleasure out of taking care of people.</p>
